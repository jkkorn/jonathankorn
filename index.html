        <h1 id="page-nav-section-1">About me</h1>
        <p>Jonathan has been in love with technology ever since he was a young boy, and has made it important that his curiosity is nourished.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s unsuprising &nbsp;that taking things apart and trying to make them better has become a big part
          of who he is.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also think’s it’s really weird when people write about themselves in third person.

        <h1 id="page-nav-Section 2">Stuff I’ve worked on</h1>
        <h3 id="page-nav-Section 2">Órama</h3>
        <p>From 2012 to 2013 I&nbsp;acted as Product Manager at Orama, a leading investment fund broker.&nbsp;&nbsp;During that period I worked on the development of Android and iOS&nbsp;apps as well as internal metrics. The metrics system allowed us to
          make better decisions about product development and ushered a more visually oriented finance platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, we followed up by creating great tools for that allowed better visualization and adminsitration of the user’s portfolio.</p>

          <h4 id="page-nav-Section 2">CoolCenter.com</h4>
          <p>Coolcenter is a spinoff project originally tailor made for one of Brazil’s largest insurance companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;The project began as an attempt to curtail the tremendous employee disatisfaction that came from using the call center’s outdated
            and fragmented software solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;From scratch we built an elegant solution using lean startup methodology and gamification principles.</p>

          <h4 id="page-nav-Section 2">BestCoFounder.com</h4>
          <p>One of Rio de Janeiro's most prestigious universities&nbsp;&nbsp;had an entrepreneurial program which wasn’t meeting expectations.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the causes was the general inability to find a cofounder or a potential business partner to
            venture with.&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at well established dating websites we copied several proven mechanics in addition to adding a few new ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon signing up, the user would classify himself as a designer, developer or business
            oriented/marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every 72 hours the website would create new groups with pre-allotted quotas for each skillset.&nbsp;&nbsp;Groups would have a chatroom and would promote for all members to meet in person.&nbsp;&nbsp;The website
            was well received and was showcased at the 2013 SXSW talk&nbsp;&nbsp;“How to Find the Co-Founder of Your Dreams”&nbsp;</p>

          <h3 id="page-nav-Section 2">Levar.me</h3>
          <p>Levar was an entrepreneurial project of mine that developed over Startup Weekend 2012. It started of as a simple ridesharing app, but due to Rio’s cultural and security limitations became something almost entirely different.&nbsp;&nbsp;By connecting
            to Facebook, Levar.me would find a friend (or someone you had a friend in common with) nearby going to the same party or concert as you.&nbsp;&nbsp;It became a very social experience and was at times comically referred to as a “&nbsp;Tinder
            on 4 wheels”&nbsp;</p>
